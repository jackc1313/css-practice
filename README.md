Esercizi per fare pratica col linguaggio CSS [presi da https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises]

These are my very first attempts at styling an index page with a style-dedicated file, by using CSS. Sometimes I integrated the CSS inside the index.html file, just to practice with the internal method too.

I'd already been pushing commits in a repository I previously forked and cloned - just wanted these commitments to be displayed on my main page as well.

I also included some practice with the Flexbox commands.
